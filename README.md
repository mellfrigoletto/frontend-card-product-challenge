Hey There! 

As a student of front-end devlopment, I chose this challenge to pratice my HTML/ CSS habilities and I believe is a great way to do it if you"re a beginner like me.
There are planty of Youtube Tutorials on this project and I encorage you to take a look if necessary, I tried this one by myself and I'm very happy with my results.
In this challenge I pratice the use of flexbox layout and mobile-first development.
